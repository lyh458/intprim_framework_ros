# Create New Experiment
In this tutorial, you will learn about the contents of the parameter files that are used in the Intprim ROS framework. After completion, you should be familiar with the functionality/responsibility of each parameter.

## **1.1 Setting up an Experiment**
In order to create an experiment, it is useful to know how the Intprim ROS framework is structured. The launchfile (which starts up Intprim Service) begins by loading the user's parameter files to the ROS server. Let's start by examining the contents of the launchfile:

```xml
<launch>
    <rosparam command="load" file="$(find intprim_framework_ros)/param/interaction.yaml" />
    <rosparam command="load" file="$(find intprim_framework_ros)/param/experiments.yaml" />
    <rosparam command="load" file="$(find intprim_framework_ros)/param/intprim_param.yaml" />

    <include file="$(find irl_robot_drivers)/launch/coppelia_controller.launch" />

    <node name="intprim_service_node" pkg="intprim_framework_ros" type="intprim_service.py" output="screen" respawn="true" />

    <node name="interaction_application_node" pkg="intprim_framework_ros" type="interaction_application" output="screen" required="true" />
</launch>

```

As you can see, there are three parameter (.yaml) files that are loaded first. These files define metadata, robots, devices, and tunable parameters. The diagram below represents the execution flow after running `roslaunch intprim_framework_ros interaction_application.launch`. Note the controller node for the CoppeliaSim robots is launched for running the simulated experiments:

### 1.1.1 Configuring experiments.yaml
The experiments.yaml file contains a list of experiments that can be executed with Intprim. As you can see below, there is only one experiment in this file; however, if you have multiple experiments, you can maintain a list of them here.

```yaml
-   id: 0
    name: "CoppeliaSim"
    timeout: 60 # In seconds
    sub_actions:
    -   prefix: "coppelia"
        message: "UR5's will touch a random point in between them..."
    devices:
    -   "ur5l" # lead
    -   "ur5c" # control
    controller: "ur5c"
```

| experiments.yaml 	| Description 	|
|:------------------|:--------	|
| id               	| Experiment id number. Allows users to define multiple experiments which will appear on the Interactive Application CLI. |
| name             	| Name as appears on the Interactive Application CLI. |
| timeout          	| Maximum time for the interaction to take place.	|
| [**sub_actions**](#sub_actions) |        	|
| devices          	| Names of the devices that will be used during the interaction. These device names specify which drivers to use for controlling the robot during an interaction. |
| controller       	| The device driver to use for controlling the robot. |
| error            	| "none" |


<a name="sub_actions"></a>

| sub_actions | Description |
|:------------|:------------|
| prefix      | This term is used to identify csv files (with the corresponding the prefix) when using them within the framework. |
| message     | What message would you like to output when starting this sub action? |


### 1.1.2 Configuring intprim_param.yaml
The intprim_param.yaml file is loaded as the "bip" param for ROS. This parameter file stores all of the information related to the degrees of freedom being captured during the experiment and the filter being used.

```yaml

## Summary
By creating three parameter files (shown above), you are able to run an experiment and perform inference with custom settings. Placing the files into the same launch file is necessary and can be done as found in the interaction_application.launch file. More information about the implementation of these parameters can be found by looking in the source code and searching for the name of the corresponding parameter.
